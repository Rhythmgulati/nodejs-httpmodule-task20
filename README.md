Certainly! Here's a brief explanation of how the server works:

Imports: The server imports the required Node.js modules: http for creating the HTTP server and handling requests, and fs for file system operations.

Port Configuration: It sets up the port for the server to listen on. It uses the value of the PORT environment variable if available, otherwise defaults to port 3000.

HTTP Server Creation: It creates an HTTP server instance using http.createServer() method. This server listens for incoming HTTP requests.

Request Handling: When a request comes in, it extracts the URL from the request object.

Routing: Depending on the URL requested, the server reads and serves different HTML files. If the URL is "/style.css", it serves the CSS file. If it's "/", "/about", or "/contact", it serves the corresponding HTML file. If none of these match, it serves an error page.

File Reading and Response: For each URL, the server reads the corresponding file using fs.readFile() method. If the file is successfully read, it sends the file content as the response. If there's an error reading the file, it sends a 500 Internal Server Error response.

Listening: The server starts listening on the specified port. When it successfully starts listening, it logs a message indicating the port it's listening on.

Overall, this server serves static HTML and CSS files based on the URL requested, providing a simple web server functionality.
